# autouploader
I have no idea how to make a privacy policy or TOS considering this is intended purely for me and isn't going to be advertised anywhere

Privacy Policy
The Auto Uploader and its associated script does not collect any personal data aside from the video provided to be uploaded. Since I'm the only one with the script to use it, it is pretty much impossible for anyone else to give personal data to the Auto Uploader. The video only remains on the hosts computer and on the hosts channel, it is never stored by the script. Completely zero personal data is utilized by the Auto Uploader.

Terms of Service
As said above in the Privacy Policy, I'm the only one with access to the application and the OAuth2 information. If someone somehow gets my script, they are permitted to do whatever they want to it and commit any configurations they want. I cannot be held responsible for any damage to a persons computer due to any changes made to the script by the user. I'm still going to be the only user though, and any use by any other party is forbidden completely.
